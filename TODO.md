# To Do

- Run full deployment checklist again. (Minify code, etc.)
  - Fix:
    - All pages:
      - Should `type` attribute be removed from all JavaScript tags?
    - Reels:
      - YouTube:
        - Switch from `frameborder=0` to CSS.
        - iFrame width should not be set to a percentage. (Is this being done in CSS?)
        - `scrolling` attribute is obsolete.
      - Line 75 section "lacks" H2. It's actually further down. Can I move it up and then use a flexbox trick to swap the visual order of the elements on the page?
- Redeploy.
- Add to my portfolio.
- Add sticky nav.
- Add Google Analytics tracking.
